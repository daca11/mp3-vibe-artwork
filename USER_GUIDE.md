## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues

#### "Upload Failed" or "File Not Accepted"

**Possible Causes**:
- File is not an MP3 format
- File is corrupted or incomplete
- File exceeds 100MB size limit
- Insufficient disk space

**Solutions**:
1. Verify file is valid MP3 format
2. Try with a smaller file first
3. Check available disk space
4. Re-download the original file if corrupted

#### "Processing Failed" for Multiple Files

**Possible Causes**:
- Insufficient system memory
- Network connectivity issues for MusicBrainz
- Corrupt metadata in MP3 files

**Solutions**:
1. Process smaller batches (5-10 files)
2. Check internet connection
3. Try disabling artwork search for batch testing
4. Review error log for specific issues

#### "Artwork Not Found" Messages

**This is Normal When**:
- Track is very new or obscure
- Artist name is misspelled in metadata
- Album information is missing or incorrect

**Solutions**:
1. Check if metadata is correct
2. Try manual filename editing before upload
3. Use "Skip Artwork" option to process without artwork
4. Manually add artwork later using other tools

#### Memory or Performance Issues

**Symptoms**:
- Slow processing
- System becomes unresponsive
- Out of memory errors

**Solutions**:
1. Close other applications
2. Process smaller batches
3. Restart the application
4. Check system has at least 4GB available memory

### Getting Help

**Error Logs**:
1. Click "üìã View Full Error Log" for detailed information
2. Export error log using "Export Log" button
3. Error logs contain timestamps and technical details

**Support Information**:
- Include error log when requesting help
- Mention your operating system and available memory

## üí° **Best Practices**

### File Organization

**Before Processing**:
- Organize files in folders by album or artist
- Ensure MP3 metadata is complete and accurate
- Back up original files before processing
- Remove any corrupted or incomplete files

**Metadata Quality**:
- Ensure Artist, Album, and Title fields are filled
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Fix typos in artist/album names for better MusicBrainz matching

### Optimal Workflow

**For Best Results**:

1. **Small Test Batch**: Start with 5-10 files to test the process
2. **Review Settings**: Confirm artwork options meet your needs
3. **Batch Processing**: Process collections in groups of 20-30 files
4. **Quality Check**: Review results before processing larger batches
5. **Backup Strategy**: Keep original files until you're satisfied

**Efficient Processing**:
- Upload files during off-peak internet hours for faster MusicBrainz searches
- Process files with existing artwork separately from those needing artwork
- Use pause/resume for long processing sessions
- Export error logs for future reference

### Quality Assurance

**Verification Steps**:
1. Test processed files in Traktor 3 before bulk processing
2. Check that artwork displays correctly
3. Verify file sizes are reasonable
4. Confirm original filenames are preserved

**Artwork Quality**:
- Prefer higher resolution source images
- Select front cover artwork when multiple options available
- Consider album vs single artwork for compilation tracks
- Review preview before confirming selection

## ‚ùì **FAQ**

### General Questions

**Q: Will this modify my original files?**  
A: No. The tool creates new processed copies in an output folder. Your original files remain untouched.

**Q: Do I need an internet connection?**  
A: Only for automatic artwork discovery via MusicBrainz. Files with existing artwork can be processed offline.

**Q: How long does processing take?**  
A: Typically 5-10 seconds per file, depending on file size and whether artwork needs to be downloaded.

**Q: Can I process the same files multiple times?**  
A: Yes. Each processing session creates new output files, so you can experiment with different settings.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What artwork formats are supported?**  
A: Input: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF. Output: JPEG (for efficiency) or PNG (for transparency).

**Q: What if my MP3 files have no metadata?**  
A: The tool attempts to parse artist and title from filenames. Manual metadata editing before upload improves results.

**Q: Are there file size limits?**  
A: 100MB per MP3 file for upload. Output artwork is optimized to under 500KB.

**Q: Does this work with other audio formats?**  
A: Currently only MP3 files are supported. Other formats may be added in future versions.

### Troubleshooting Questions

**Q: Why didn't MusicBrainz find artwork for my file?**  
A: Possible reasons: incorrect metadata, very new/obscure release, non-standard spelling. Try correcting metadata or manual artwork selection.

**Q: Can I cancel processing once it's started?**  
A: Yes. Use the "üõë Cancel" button. Files already processed will be available; remaining files will be skipped.

**Q: What happens if I close the browser during processing?**  
A: Processing continues on the server. Refresh the page to see current status. Your session ID preserves your progress.

**Q: Why are some files processed successfully while others fail?**  
A: Common reasons: corrupted MP3 files, invalid metadata, network issues during artwork download. Check error log for specifics.
